# Nuanced Multi-class Detection of Machine-Generated Scientific Text

## Overview

This repository contains the dataset and model details for the paper titled "Nuanced Multi-class Detection of Machine-Generated Scientific Text." Our work focuses on detecting machine-generated scientific text across multiple domains, addressing not only binary classification but also the classification of practical usages of large language models (LLMs), such as paraphrasing, summarization, and title-based generation. We also introduce a novel baseline model that integrates contrastive learning to improve the model's ability to discern similar texts effectively.

## Dataset

We provide a comprehensive dataset that is designed to aid in the nuanced detection of machine-generated scientific text. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, each labeled with one of four categories: generated, paraphrase, summarized, and human-written.
